# 🔢 Digit Classifier (FastAPI + Streamlit)

Digit Classifier is a learning-focused machine learning project that predicts handwritten digits from user-provided images.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end workflow: model inference served via FastAPI and consumed through a Streamlit-based frontend.

The application runs locally and allows users to download sample images, upload inputs, and test the trained model.
